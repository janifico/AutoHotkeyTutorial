# An AutoHotkey tutorial with usable code

[AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) is a great scripting language (for Windows) for non-programmers that helps make repetitive tasks, that get in the way of doing actual work, quick to execute.

This tutorial is more of a collection of scripts accompanied by an explanation of how they work.
Each script is short, easy to understand, and, while certainly usable as they are provided, they are easy to modify to suit your specific needs.

This tutorial is suitable for absolute beginners since it starts off from installation and moves on from there.
If you are an experienced programmer or have some experience writing scripts then you will probably find the explanantions elementary.

## The official tutorial versus this one

In my experience, beginner tutorials for programming languages are great but usually leave the reader feeling lost, not knowing what to do with this new found knowledge.
Furthermore, encountering an error is incredibly frustrating when you create a script that you were sure was going to work.
Spending time and effort diagnosing problems with a script that was supposed to make life easier defeats the purpose of the script.

The tutorial in the official documentation does an amazing job of explaining how to write AutoHotkey code and the concepts behind the code but doesn't really teach you how to create something well put together. 
For anything beyond the basics it's up to the reader to go forum digging for code they'll actually use.

Approach this tutorial as a collection of handy short scripts for automating things you likely do yourself. 
The explanations are there as a guide and to help you understand the code. 
Once you understand the code, you can make modifications that suit your needs.

## Who is this for?

This collection is the result of several searches in forums and tutorials.
When I started out scripting with AutoHotkey I had no experience with scripting or programming.
I was looking for a simple way to interact with programs I used everyday like Excel, Word, and Chrome.
If you are in a similar situation then you should find the code here useful and the explanations instructive.
